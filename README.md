**Exploring Fire Response Times in London: 
A Data-Driven Approach to Analysis and Modeling**

Fire incidents pose a significant threat to public safety, resulting in substantial loss of life and property. In England alone, the economic and social cost of fire reached Â£12.0 billion in 2020. A critical factor in mitigating these losses is the emergency response time, which varies significantly across regions due to geographical, socioeconomic, and infrastructural factors. This study focuses on London, a city with diverse social structures and resource allocation, to analyze fire response times and identify patterns and influencing factors. Using data from the London Fire Brigade (2018-2023), we employ statistical methods, including ANOVA and Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMM), to explore spatial variations and the impact of variables such as income deprivation, road density, and fire station distribution. Our findings reveal significant differences in response times between Inner and Outer London, highlighting the need for optimized resource allocation and infrastructure improvements to enhance emergency service efficiency. This research provides a statistical basis for policymakers to address service imbalances and improve fire response strategies in urban areas.
